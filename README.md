# Global Temperature Heatmap

This project utilizes D3.js to create a heatmap representing global temperature variances over time. It fetches temperature data from a JSON file and visualizes it on a canvas.

## Files

- `styles.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles and layout of the heatmap and tooltip.

- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for fetching the temperature data, generating scales, drawing cells and axes, and handling interactions with the heatmap.
